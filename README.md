# About me
- I am Gaygysyz (pronounced as Gaigisiz) Guljanov
- statistician/econometrician by training with relevant machine learning experience.
- recently defended my PhD thesis titled "Estimation of DSGE models: Skewness matters"

If you would like to collaborate on any project, do not hesitate to contact me.

# Main Projects
<!--
### Comparison of samplers and optimizers in Dynare and in the context of Bayesian identification strength
- First project of my doctoral dissertation
- Replication codes are coming soon
-->
  
### Pruned Skewed Kalman Filter and Smoother: With Applications to the Yield Curve and Asymmetric Monetary Policy Shocks
A project from my doctoral thesis where I together with co-authors 
- developed pruning algorithm for the skewed Kalman filter
- derived skewed Kalman smoother
- estimated Yield Curve and a small-scale DSGE model assuming skewness for structural shocks

### Pruned Skewed Kalman Filter
- Implementation of Pruned Skewed Kalman Filter in Python, R, Julia, and MATLAB

<!--
### Uncovering Skewed Structural Macroeconomic Shocks Using Enhanced Pruned Skewed Kalman Filter: A Detailed Analysis with a Medium-Scale DSGE Model
- Third project of my doctoral dissertation
